## some mysql commands:
select * from zacks.portfolio_scan;
select * from zacks.portfolio_operations;
select * from zacks.portfolio_scan where record_date = CURDATE();

## TODO
Add mysql data deduplication, because records in additions might not have price data at beginning, later it would be
added in webpage. Which will have two additions of same symbol, same day, same portfolio, similar vol_percent,
